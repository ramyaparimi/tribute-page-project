          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
              Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
              scars on me."</p>

            <p><span class="bold">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
              cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
              breeding pest-resistent plants.</p>

              rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
              wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
              6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate
              on Earth.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">1953</span> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
              American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
              wheat.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian

              sorghum yields</p>
          </li>

            <p><span class="bold">1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p>

          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues
              that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
              animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="bold">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.
